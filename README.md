Odin Project Testing Practice


Overview:
This repository is part of the Odin Project's curriculum, focused on practicing JavaScript testing using Jest. The exercises here help reinforce the concepts of unit testing, test-driven development (TDD), and best practices in writing testable code.

What I Learned:
Unit Testing with Jest: Writing and running tests for individual units of code.
Test-Driven Development (TDD): Developing code by writing tests first.
Mocking Functions: Simulating functions and modules to test interactions.
Code Coverage: Measuring how much of the code is tested.

Prerequisites:
Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/jonjon231564/odin-project-testing-practice.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd odin-project-testing-practice
Install the dependencies: npm install

Running Tests:
To run the tests, use the following command: npm test

File Structure:
main.js: Contains the main functions to be tested.
main.test.js: Contains the test cases for the functions in main.js.
babel.config.js: Configuration file for Babel to enable ES6+ support in Jest.
